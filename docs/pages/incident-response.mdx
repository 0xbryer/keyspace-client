# Incident Response

## Replacing the Sequencer

Keyspace will likely launch with permissioned sequencing, which means that if the Keyspace team's sequencer goes down, another operator on the allowlist needs to be ready to sequence the rollup.

## Exiting Keyspace

The current integration designs for Keyspace leave room for wallet vendors to migrate off of Keyspace in the event of liveness failures. The wallet implementation contract can be changed over time, which means an upgrade transaction can transition to a contract that does not rely on Keyspace at all.

:::warning
Wallet contract upgrades can mitigate liveness failures, but if the Keyspace root somehow ends up in an inconsistent state, upgrades will not be able to be processed by the wallet.
