# Authentication & Circuits

When you're building a Keyspace-integrated smart wallet, your authentication logic will be duplicated: your smart contract needs to verify the signatures when processing transactions, but now so does your `Account` circuit to verify signatures when the user wants to change their key configuration. The changes needed to your contracts are described in [Contracts](/contracts).

The `Account` circuit facilitates zero-knowledge SNARK proofs that an authorized user has changed the wallet's configuration. All `Account` circuits take the `currentData` of the Keyspace record and the `newKey` as public inputs. Note that `newKey` does not actually change the record's constant key: it's merely a commitment to the new configuration that is calculated in the same manner as the original key.

## Current Circuits

### EcdsaAccount

Authorize key configuration changes with an secp256k1 signature, just like Ethereum EOA signatures.

### WebAuthnAccount

Authorize key configuration changes with a WebAuthn passkey signature, which uses the secp256r1 (P256) curve and standard WebAuthn signature payloads.

## Planned Circuits

### M-of-N Multisig

Configure one or more secp256k1 or WebAuthn signers along with a threshold for how many signatures are required to update the configuration. We expect this circuit to be repurposed for more Keyspace integrations, even for wallets that aren't explicitly multisignature wallets.
